MEDICINE.
In the next two decades, synthetic biology technologies will be harnessed to eradicate life-threatening disease and to develop personalized medicines for individual people and their specific genetic circumstances. Researchers will genetically engineer viruses to treat cancer, and they will grow human tissue in a lab for organ transplantation and to test new therapeutic treatments. New technologies will monitor us continuously, eliminating traditional doctor’s exams. Most importantly, we will engineer healthier people: predicting and eliminating genetic disorders, and potentially making enhancements, to babies before they are born.
Eradicating Disease.
Before a short vacation to India, a doctor made sure her wife and two children were all up to date on their shots: polio; measles, mumps, and rubella; diphtheria; chicken pox; flu; hepatitis A and B; tetanus.1 They weren’t traveling to an area with cholera or yellow fever outbreaks. They were staying in New Delhi and planned to make day trips to various tourist sites. Watching the sun set over the Taj Mahal in Agra was magic: as the light gradually faded, it cast a vivid orange-pink filter over the bright marble buildings. A perfect day, but for the swarm of mosquitoes that thickened as the colors changed.
A few weeks after the family came back home, one of the moms—the doctor—felt as if she’d gotten the flu. She was stricken with chills, fever, and body aches, so she drank some water, took some Advil, and went to bed. But her condition quickly deteriorated. By the time she arrived at the hospital, her blood pressure was falling. The triage nurse asked a long list of questions: Had she taken any new medications? Did she have any allergies? And finally, had she traveled out of the country recently? As soon as the doctor mentioned that night at the Taj Mahal, the nurse called for an infectious disease specialist. It turned out to be a very good call: the doctor had contracted malaria, the deadly disease carried by mosquitoes.
Mosquitoes use the sharp tip of their needle-like mouths to pierce your skin and leech blood from your body as they also inject an anticoagulant to prevent your blood from clotting. Only female mosquitoes have this specialized set of biomechanics; male insects feed on plant nectar. Since females feed on animals and people, female mosquitoes are key vectors for disease. They spread malaria, dengue fever, and a bunch of viruses: West Nile, Zika, chikungunya, and Eastern equine encephalitis, among many others. What’s the most prolific and deadly predator on Earth? It isn’t a snake, shark, or scorpion. It’s not a bear. It’s not even humans. It’s the mosquito.
Each year, malaria kills more than four hundred thousand people, most of whom are young children.2 The disease isn’t caused by a virus or bacteria, but rather an organism called a plasmodium. Plasmodia are clever, shape-shifting organisms adept at evading immune systems, which is why they spread and persist. The only vaccine that exists for malaria requires four injections and is relatively ineffective: it only provides temporary resistance. Someone infected with malaria can become reinfected over and over again. The best defense we currently have against the disease is early diagnosis and treatment. That a doctor misdiagnosed her own case of malaria tells you something about how dangerous malaria is—and why mosquitoes became an early target for synthetic biology.
Because we cannot easily get rid of disease-carrying mosquitoes—they breed quickly and are hard to capture—we’ve instead spent decades developing lotions and sprays to ward them off. The US Army used DEET as a repellent after World War II, but DEET is toxic. (When mixed incorrectly, it can melt plastic.) Besides, some mosquitoes have developed a genetic resistance to it.
But there is now a way to prevent malaria from spreading without having to kill trillions of mosquitoes. In 2021, geneticists at the Imperial College of London used a “gene drive”—a genetic modification that results in a majority of offspring carrying a desired trait—to deal with this disease. They relied on the gene-editing technology of CRISPR—that editing technique to cut a specific site in DNA—to modify the sexual development and other traits of female mosquitoes. Females born with the edited genes have different mouths, so they can’t bite, and they also can’t lay eggs, which means they can’t spread the malaria parasite. Without the gene drive, the mutation would have spread too slowly through the population; with it, nearly 100 percent of offspring inherit the new mouth design. Gene drive technology is powerful—and permanent.
New mosquitoes with different genetic modifications are being developed and tested at scale in a high-security facility in Terni, Italy, and elsewhere.4 In 2021, millions of other genetically engineered mosquitoes were scheduled for release in the Florida Keys to curb the spread of Zika. The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District Board of Commissioners had approved a pilot project to introduce genetically edited male mosquitoes that pass on a gene that makes it difficult for their offspring to reproduce.5 Local authorities, who have been dealing with steadily growing cases of dengue fever and West Nile virus, believe that a smaller mosquito population will curb the diseases—and stop them from needing to douse the Keys with insecticides or poisonous chemicals.
