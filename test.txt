The End (and Rebirth) of Medicine.
Manufacturers update the prices of medications semiannually, and drug prices are continually rising. During the January 2019 update, for example, 468 drugs increased in price in the United States by an average of 5.2 percent; in the January 2021 update, 832 drugs increased an average of 4.5 percent.15 Drug manufacturers argue that patients don’t see those increases at the pharmacy when they’re picking up prescriptions, because insurance plans pay for the added costs. But list price changes have significant downstream “effects on the overall cost of health care in America, with prices that continue to skyrocket. Insurance costs have increased a staggering 740 percent in the past thirty years. More than half of Americans rely on their employers for health insurance, which subsidizes those costs. Employer-based insurance for an average family costs businesses $20,576 a year, but such insurance still leaves families on the hook for a lot of expenses, including deductibles and medications that aren’t covered.
Expensive medicine is an addressable problem. One easy fix would be to empower people to know their baselines for key physical metrics, thanks to diagnostic equipment in their own homes. When a patient visits a doctor in Japan, she is asked for her normal temperature, rather than the doctor assuming it’s 37°C (or 98.6°F). Many people are a few tenths of a degree away from that average number. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only a temperature of 100.4°F and above is considered a fever, but patients with normal (for them) temperatures of 97.9 and 99.0 would have far different physical responses to a fever of 100.4. Aside from body temperature, there are thousands of other data points swirling around the body that could indicate anomalies relative to any individual person. Sensors, wearables, and ingestibles would feed data to machine learning systems, determine whether someone is deviating from their baseline, and provide people with actionable information.
An intervention could be as simple as drinking a glass of water, or, for more serious conditions, perhaps we would harness our own internal drug factories, using custom microbes and biological code—rather than swallowing twenty-seven pills a day, or suffering through an ad hoc combination of chemotherapies never intended for your particular cancer. This would eliminate the need for expensive drugs that were designed for the masses rather than your unique biological circumstances. It would also challenge the mechanics of our current pharmaceutical and health insurance industries. With enough public trust and acceptance, it could end medicine as we know it, which is expensive, unevenly distributed, and inaccessible to many. We could transition to a system of personalized medicine, with better health equity and outcomes for everyone.
But the ultimate prevention strategy for genetic disorders, diseases, and cancers linked to heritable genes is to predict, detect, and avert them before we are born. Some people opt in to genetic screening tests that can be performed even before pregnancy to determine whether the parents are carriers of disease. Tay-Sachs, a rare and fatal genetic disorder that destroys nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, occurs more frequently in people with Ashkenazi roots. Prospective parents whose ancestors were Jewish and emigrated from Eastern or Central Europe can take an “Ashkenazi Panel” to determine whether they are carriers for the disease. Other markers can also now be tested. In vitro fertilization typically results in multiple embryos, and some people employing that technology choose to screen embryos for conditions such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis before implantation.
Researchers are developing a new technique that might someday enable people to upgrade their children before birth. Using algorithms to understand the tiny variations in DNA—single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs—they hope to make accurate gene-based predictions about an individual’s future. If SNPs were read in vitro, before embryos were implanted, they could reveal whether that genetic combination had a higher probability of developing heart disease or diabetes. If an embryo was edited using CRISPR, embryos could also be optimized with the best possible traits, given the raw genetic material. Theoretically, parents could influence myriad traits for their offspring, including hair texture, resistance to a virus such as HIV or protection against Alzheimer’s disease. This intervention, like the gene drive edit in mosquitoes, would have a permanent, heritable effect. It could eradicate certain diseases passed from parents to children, and in the process improve the entire gene pool.
Depending on where you stand, this will sound somewhere between “really exciting” and “gravely concerning.” We will address existential risks in the next chapter. So far, at least, caution and ethical concerns have the upper hand. A dozen countries have banned germline engineering in humans, though their ranks do not include the United States or China. The European Union’s Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine says tampering with the gene pool would be a crime against human dignity and human rights. But all these declarations were made before it was actually possible to precisely engineer the germline. Now, with CRISPR, it is possible.
Many other possibilities that once would have strained credulity now loom. An emerging technology called in vitro gametogenesis, or IVG, will soon allow same-sex couples to create a baby using their own genetic material without requiring donor eggs or sperm. A Japanese scientist, Shinya Yamanaka, won the Nobel Prize in 2012 for his remarkable discovery: a method to turn any cell in the human body into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs for short), which can be reprogrammed with the functions of any other cell. Researchers at Kyoto University used that technology in 2016 to transform iPSCs from a mouse’s tail into eggs, and eventually, baby mice. With this technology, our definition of genetic “parents” will shift drastically in the next few decades, from our current one-father-one-mother construct to parenthood in many different permutations. LGBTQ couples will be able to reproduce more easily using their own genetic material, without the need for donors. A woman who chooses to have children would no longer need a man’s donor sperm: eventually, the technology will allow her to conceive a baby using her own genetic materials, and no one else’s.
And if a man or female-identifying person wants to become a parent someday? IVG will produce an embryo, but bringing that baby to full maturity would still require a gestational carrier. Historically, that has always been a woman; however, researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia created an artificial womb, called a biobag, which they used to keep premature lambs alive and developing normally for twenty-eight days. In March 2021, a team of Israeli scientists grew mice from embryos in a completely artificial womb and kept them alive for eleven days.23 We are still years away from synthesizing and growing a full-size organic womb, but the biobag represents a gestational carrier intervention that could help the thousands of premature babies born every year—and portends an eventual future in which humans may not need to carry their pregnancies at all. Within a generation, our conception of a “nuclear family” could look radically different, and far more inclusive, than it does today.
