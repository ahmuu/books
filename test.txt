Imagine a world in which shrimp are produced in a lab. One where they’re not brought to market by ships trawling (and destroying) the sea floor with giant nets, thus leaving all the other fish and aquatic life typically ensnared in those nets blissfully undisturbed. Imagine if fruit were grown indoors, all year round, just beneath the grocery stores that sell them. Instead of harvesting berries before they are fully ripe, blasting them with temperature-controlled washes to kill pests, sealing them in shipping containers, and sending them halfway around the world, you could pick what you wanted right off the bush.
Or imagine a future in which healthy living was about upgrades and optimization, rather than restriction. One where hangovers would become a relic of a bygone era, because, before enjoying a night out, you’d eat a special probiotic supplement to prevent alcohol’s notorious aftereffects. Imagine a world in which dieting was unnecessary, because a biometric test would reveal your body’s metabolic levels, food sensitivities, and other data, so you’d know which foods to eat, what to drink, and when.

Imagine a world in which genetic diseases that cripple and kill infants, such as sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy, would all be prevented before birth.
Now think back to all the screens you’ve cracked, nails you’ve chipped, and lenses you’ve destroyed in one way or another. Imagine the day when biological coatings ensured that surfaces would quickly heal themselves, regardless of the damage inflicted upon them. No matter how many times you misjudged exactly how to maneuver in and out of your garage, the finish on your car would still look pristine. Organic nail polish would dry without the need for harmful UV lights or harsh chemical topcoats.
The foundation for these alternate realities already exists. In fact, some of these innovations are already moving from the fringe to the mainstream as the bioeconomy’s capabilities come into focus.
Many key phases of human progress have been described in terms of the materials we used to transform our built environments. During the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, humans created the basic technologies for everyday tools, agriculture, construction, and warfare. Later, we harnessed glass for ornamentation, bottles, windows, lenses, and medical equipment. Steel enabled us to build skyscrapers. Plastic made the mass production of disposable containers possible, which led to global supply chains for food, medicines, and water, among other products. Our current moment—in which we are learning to manipulate molecules, engineer microorganisms, and build biocomputing systems—is the start of a new era in civilization’s evolution: the Biological Age. What we build during this new age will unlock new business opportunities, mitigate or even reverse environmental damage, and improve the human condition in countless other ways—both on Earth and in off-planet colonies.
Synthetic biology will transform three key areas of life: medicine, the global supply of food, and the environment.
