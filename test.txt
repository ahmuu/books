Personalizing Medicine.
CRISPR allows scientists to edit precise positions on DNA using a bacterial enzyme. Roughly eight thousand diseases originate from just a single gene. Such monogenic, or single-gene, disorders were difficult to diagnose and treat before we had DNA sequencing. They include sickle cell anemia (a heritable condition that causes red blood cells to contort into a sickle shape) and cystic fibrosis (which causes the body to produce a thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive system). But CRISPR could correct these gene mutations, and the cell’s DNA repair machinery could restore edited cells back to health.
Even more people suffer from polygenic diseases, which are more complex to manage because they stem from the combined actions of more than one gene. Coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis are polygenic conditions. So is hypertension, which in some people is heritable. Amy’s father is one of those people. He was diagnosed with severe hypertension in his early twenties, when his blood pressure suddenly went haywire: seemingly out of nowhere, his nose started bleeding, and he became so dizzy that he fell over. He was otherwise healthy and active, had never smoked, and had avoided alcohol because of his religious upbringing. But the first time he displayed any symptoms left him in a life-threatening situation. For the past fifty years, he’s been under the care of specialists at the Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hypertension Center, who regularly tinker with the dosages of the complex cocktail of prescription medications he takes: he must swallow twenty-seven pills throughout the day, every day, to stay alive. The job of his physicians now is to figure out how to counteract the side effects of all those meds on his body, with additional medications that also weren’t designed specifically for him. A conservative estimate of his medical expenses, between all those prescriptions, doctor visits, and occasional trips to the emergency room, is $50,000 annually, which adds up to roughly $3 million in health-care costs during his lifetime—and that’s before you start adjusting those costs for inflation. He’s in a privileged situation: he has excellent insurance, access to world-class research hospitals and physicians, and a supportive and helpful family. Still, synthetic biology techniques could, in the future, target and edit or rewrite the specific portion of the genome responsible for his hypertension.
What about all the other diseases that require medication, but won’t respond to CRISPR editing? In the future, therapeutics could be made as needed, rather than manufactured at a global scale. As we saw in the previous chapter, portable sequencing machines can already determine the presence of a virus or bacteria, and the technology to produce real-time medications isn’t far off.
If you were able to sequence a genome quickly and had the right materials to synthesize a treatment, you could print out a protective barrier to defend against any number of pathogens. Imagine a kit that included freeze-dried molecules that were engineered for later insertion into a cell. The molecule would remain dormant until you needed to use it, like the dried beans and mushrooms you might use to make soup. Activating the treatment would require adding just the right amount of water to rehydrate and bring the biological system back online. Once up and running, you would then add engineered DNA instructions for vaccines or antibiotics. Hikers, athletes, soldiers in the field, and school nurses could carry a kit the size of an iPhone and mix medications whenever and wherever they were needed.
Beating Cancer.
Amy’s mother developed a rare form of neuroendocrine cancer in her mid-fifties. Her cancer didn’t have an obvious culprit. She didn’t drink or smoke, and aside from being overweight—she had a sweet tooth and loved French fries—she was vibrant and healthy. The symptoms, too, were unusual: her skin seemed to turn yellow overnight, and she lost weight quickly. Her primary care physician referred her to a team of specialists at the University of Chicago, who then referred her to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas. She had a cancerous tumor, but that wasn’t the problem. Doctors had detected worrisome cells far away from that site, with traits similar to both nerve and hormone cells. They showed up at her pancreas and in her lungs, and they were aggressive and replicating quickly. When the DNA of a neuroendocrine cell mutates, it seems to cause Tumors to grow anywhere spontaneously. Which meant that this one visible tumor likely wasn’t the only one already growing inside her body.
She fought valiantly, insisting that life would go on as planned. She covered the chemotherapy port in her arm with long sleeves, found a wig that matched her trademark pixie haircut, and continued teaching her fourth-grade class. Because physicians could not find the primary site where cells were going bad, they were forced to combine chemotherapy treatments designed for other cancers. She spent Saturdays connected to IV bags, under warm blankets, without the wig, without the brave face she wore everywhere else. The first four hours were spent connected to an IV bag designed to treat pancreatic cancer, and the second four with a bag designed to treat lung cancer. She would finish six or eight weeks of treatments, take a few weeks off to regain her strength, and begin another round. Chemo was both keeping her alive and drastically shortening her life. After a year she decided, with family support, to enter hospice care. She was gone a few days later.
It would be difficult to develop a single, universal vaccine for cancer, because each cancer is unique, and cancer isn’t a single disease but rather a catch-all term for a constellation of more than a hundred known genetic mutations. Perhaps that’s why we tend to name cancers by location rather than mutation: lung cancer, bone cancer, neuroendocrine cancer. But individualized vaccines could be developed to defeat the mysterious cancer that killed Amy’s mother, with genetically engineered viruses designed to target and kill cancer cells. Another option: using mRNA to spur the body to build up its immunological defenses to find and kill cancers, while also protecting against them in the first place. One way this can be done is through CAR T-cell therapy, which is short for chimeric antigen receptor cell transfer. In this treatment, the T-cells (specialized white blood cells) are spun out of a patient’s blood, modified in the lab, and reinjected to fight off the cancer cells.
Long before they were making COVID-19 vaccines, both Moderna and BioNTech were researching immunotherapies for cancer. After analyzing a tissue sample from a cancerous tumor, the companies ran genetic analyses to develop custom mRNA vaccines, which encode protein-containing mutations unique to the patient’s tumor. The immune system uses those instructions to search and destroy similar cells all throughout the body, which is similar to how the companies’ COVID-19 vaccines work. BioNTech is currently in clinical trials for personalized vaccines for many cancers, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. Moderna is developing similar cancer vaccines. Both companies understand that the world’s most powerful drug manufacturing factory on Earth may already be inside you. We just need to figure out all the ways we can harness it.
Customized, Lab-Grown Human Tissue.
mRNA cancer vaccines or custom viruses would need to be tested rigorously, and in an ideal world, quickly. Such clinical trials are costly and require a lengthy regulatory review. In the absence of an emergency like COVID-19, it can take a decade or longer to get all the approvals. It’s also difficult and dangerous for scientists to study how living human tissue responds to viruses and medications. Brain or heart tissue, for example, can’t be excised from a living person. We need a way to make it easier to test new treatments and reduce the time it takes to develop them.
Synthetic biology has some solutions for these problems. It offers us, for example, the ability to engineer and grow organoids—tiny blobs of tissue grown from human stem cells. As we write this, lab-grown lung and brain tissues are being used to research the lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2.6 Miniature guts and livers are also being grown, and infected with the virus, in high-security labs. The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is leading a unique $24 million federally funded project to develop a “body on a chip,” which will include different combinations of organoids.7 Picture a computer chip, but with a transparent circuit board that’s connected to a system pumping a blood substitute through it. With it, researchers can poison a mock respiratory system with new viruses, lethal chemicals, or other toxins to see how the body would react, and then test potential treatments on living human tissue without harming humans or other animals.
Miniature snippets of the nervous system are being used to create miniature blobs of brain tissue. In 2008, researchers created the first cerebral organoids, which provided a better understanding of certain brain functions. Cerebral organoids have since been used to research autism and other diseases, such as the Zika virus.8 When joined together, lab-grown muscles and cerebral organoids can establish neural highways and process information. Researchers at Stanford University are experimenting with self-assembling tissue, which they dubbed “assembloids,” that respond to stimuli.9 Starting with human stem cells that sew themselves together in a petri dish, the researchers “developed a working prototype of a nerve-cell circuit that represents the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle. When they stimulated the cortex cells, the message was transmitted all the way to the muscle, which twitched in the lab dish. In another study, researchers created human forebrain organoids—the forebrain is the part of the brain responsible for thinking, perceiving, and evaluating our surroundings. Research is underway elsewhere that would transplant bits of human brain organoids into rats, which raises both complex ethical concerns and, perhaps, fears of super-rats that process information as well as humans. But more on that in the next chapter.
Doctorless Exams.
When deCODEme’s genetic testing kit first hit the market in 2007, it promised to assess consumers’ genomes for disease risk and origins. The Iceland-based company then charged $985 for a screening.10 That same year, Google-funded 23andMe began offering genetic testing for $1,000 and returned results in a few weeks, along with access to an online Genome Explorer dashboard.11 Both raised concerns among genetic counselors, the specially trained health professionals that advise would-be parents and people diagnosed with genetic disorders, who thought that customers would gain access to their genetic risks without having sufficient context to interpret the test results. Initially, 23andMe was only authorized to ship its kits to a handful of states, as laws in Maryland and New York, among others, prohibited residents from buying any direct-to-consumer tests that provided health information. In 2017, the FDA finally allowed 23andMe to market its tests for ten conditions, which included markers for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.12
But consumer tests aren’t just about genetic fortune-telling. The human microbiome is a mini-universe of the genetic materials living on and inside of our bodies, which we inherit from our gestational mothers. The number of genes in the bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses that make up our microbiomes is two hundred times the number of the genes in the human genome. That microbiome weighs nearly five pounds, and it lives mostly in your gut and on your skin. Microbiomes differ greatly from person to person, even if they’re siblings who live in the same city. How well you digest lactose, how vulnerable you are to skin cancer, how well you sleep, your probability of developing anxiety or becoming obese—all of these traits are linked to the microbiome and influenced by what you eat and drink, whether you smoke, what chemicals your body comes into contact with, and what medications you take. That data once was collected over several visits to an allergist, but today, at-home tests can determine the genetic makeup of your microbiome. Some companies will mix together special probiotic compounds to mitigate conditions or optimize the symbiotic relationship your body has with all those microorganisms.
Which means that the next frontier in medicine could be doctorless exams. You won’t have to worry about making appointments to visit a diagnostic lab, and then wait in lines at the lab and wait even longer for results, because a new crop of technologies will analyze your data at home. Such technologies will start with the everyday equipment in your bathroom, which you’ll soon use to collect biological samples for daily monitoring and testing. To be blunt about it, our toilets already come into direct contact every day with two key sources of data—our skin and our waste—so they offer an excellent route to monitoring our real-time health. That’s what gave Stanford University researchers the idea for a diagnostic toilet, albeit one outfitted with the sort of equipment you don’t typically want inside a bathroom: cameras, microphones, pressure sensors, tiny robotic arms, motion detectors, infrared sensors, and a computer system equipped with computer vision and machine learning.13 Their hunch was that regular diagnostic samples could be used as an early warning system for gut disorders, liver and kidney diseases, and cancers. It turned out to be correct. If you were following the Stanford experiments, Toto’s “Wellness Toilet” shouldn’t have come as a surprise when it was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2021. As far-fetched as this may sound, this is a real device intended for everyday use: the high-tech toilet uses a similar array of sensors to analyze “key outputs” and provide users with insights on hydration and their diets.
There are portable kits, too: the at-home test startup Healthy.io has developed a urinary tract infection test kit that uses a mobile app to connect patients who have positive results with an online doctor and sends a prescription to a nearby pharmacy if needed. Healthy.io also partnered with the National Kidney Foundation to offer an annual kidney test kit to detect early signs of disease.
In the near future, diagnostics will require even less effort, as wearable and ingestible devices will provide data for remote health monitoring (RHM). Phones and wearables have long been collecting and interpreting such data; consider how people who wear an Apple Watch know that an unusually high or low heart rate or irregular rhythm may suggest atrial fibrillation. Smartphones and smartwatches now take blood pressure readings and perform electrocardiograms, using apps approved by the Food and Drug Administration. RHM uses a network of digital technologies, the internet, and the cloud to collect medical data from patients and then transmit it for remote assessment by their health-care providers. Lots of data—heart rate, electrocardiograms, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, kidney function, and more—can be mined to manage cases offsite. RHM can keep older people in their own homes longer, and it can reduce the number of in-person visits to clinics and hospitals. Ingestibles, which are tiny, pill-sized computers outfitted with sensors, cameras, and transmitters, can collect data from inside your body and beam it out to an AI-powered system for analysis. Researchers at MIT have developed an ingestible-based bacterial-electronic system to monitor gut health.14 Other ingestibles can detect bleeding or tissue abnormalities, or even check to make sure a patient is taking prescribed medication.
